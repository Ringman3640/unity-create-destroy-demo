# unity-create-destroy-demo
A basic Unity project demonstration on constructing and destroying game objects. The user controls an icon in the game (an arrow) and can shoot and crash into enemy object (planes). Multiple system scripts keep track of various game object loads and counts, such as the total number of enemies and projectiles on-screen at a given moment.
